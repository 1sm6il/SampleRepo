Non-veg foods, like meat and poultry work as the primary source of iron in the body. Iron is highly important not only to keep blood deficiency at bay but also to ensure smooth functioning of the brain.
People who do not eat non-vegetarian diet, are at much higher risk of suffering from iron deficiency, which can be deadly for the health and well being of any one.
Calcium is a very important mineral for human body as it works as the main constituents of the skeletal system as well as the teeth.
Non-veg foods contain a much higher amount of calcium than vegetarian foods, and hence people having non-veg foods regularly are least likely to suffer from calcium deficiency compared to the vegetarians.
